# rofretta-java
---
This project provides a model for chord voicings for stringed instruments. As of right now, it will identify chords for 
you based on what frets are depressed + tuning as well as load up chords from a simple text-based file format (see rofretta-common for spec, example file). 

Its JDK 8 only, and its mostly exists so I can experiment. You may find this useful, you may not.
