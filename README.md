# rofretta-java
---
A zillion years ago I wrote a java swing app I called "fretastic" that didn't do much - it was basically an editor where you could
enter in chord fingerings, like anyone wanted to spend the time to hand enter chord voicings one-by-one using a point
and click editor. Way too tedious, what was I thinking?

This project is currently an experiment in mondernizing an old project, seeing what still interests me. It probably doesn't interest you (yet?).
